# Carmen Sandiego SQL Lab üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## Overview

This project was part of my SQL Lab homework in Unit 4 at General Assembly. The objective: track down and capture the notorious thief **Carmen Sandiego** using real SQL queries over a world database.

I worked through 7 clues, each one requiring a deeper understanding of querying data with PostgreSQL, joining tables, filtering with `WHERE`, pattern matching with `ILIKE`, and performing subqueries.

## What I Learned

- **Filtering with WHERE** to locate data by region, population, and language.
- **Sorting and limiting results** to find the least populated country or capital city.
- **Joining tables** (`JOIN`) to combine country and language data.
- **Subqueries** to filter based on another query‚Äôs result.
- **Pattern matching** with `ILIKE` to find similarly named cities.
- **Using metadata and IDs** to lookup and connect table data (`capital` ID to city name).
- **Using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`** to isolate countries with a single official language.

## Final Reflections

This lab was a fun and clever way to reinforce real SQL concepts in a narrative setting. It helped me feel more comfortable chaining together logic, interpreting data relationships, and using SQL as an investigative tool. I especially appreciated using joins and subqueries in ways that mimicked real-world scenarios.
